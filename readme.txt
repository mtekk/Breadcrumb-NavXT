This plugin generates locational breadcrumb trails for your WordPress powered blog or website.

The Administrative interface makes setting options easy, while a direct class access is available for theme developers and more adventurous users.

See the [Calling the Breadcrumb Trail](http://mtekk.us/archives/guides/calling-the-breadcrumb-trail "Read more on calling the breadcrumb trail") article for more information on calling the breadcrumb trail.

To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT.
