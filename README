Adds breadcrumb navigation showing the visitor's path to their current location.

== Description ==

Breadcrumb NavXT, the successor to the popular WordPress plugin Breadcrumb Navigation XT, was written from the ground up to be better than its ancestor. This plugin generates locational breadcrumb trails for your WordPress powered blog or website. These breadcrumb trails are highly customizable to suit the needs of just about any website running WordPress. The Administrative interface makes setting options easy, while a direct class access is available for theme developers and more adventurous users.

== Installation ==
Open the appropriate file for your theme (typically header.php). This can be done within WordPress’ administration panel through Presentation > Theme Editor or through your favorite text editor. Place the following code where you want the breadcrumb trail to appear.
`<div class="breadcrumbs">
    <?php if(function_exists('bcn_display'))
    {
        bcn_display();
    }?>
</div>`
Save the file (upload if applicable). Now you should have a breadcrumb trail on your WordPress powered site. To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 5.0.0 =
This version is for the developers, those who like to extend things gracefully. Several new hooks were introduced, while others were tweaked to be more useful. If you have WordPress setup as a multisite install/in network mode, the new Breadcrumb NavXT network settings page will take priority over the individual sub site settings pages. This is a major change from previous versions. See [Controlling Breadcrumb NavXT Settings From the Network Settings Page](http://mtekk.us/archives/guides/controlling-breadcrumb-navxt-settings-from-the-network-settings-page/"Go to the article on controlling the settings hierarchy") for more information on the new settings modes.
